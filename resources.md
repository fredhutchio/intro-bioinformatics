# Class resources

Most of these resources are tucked away towards the end of various class sections, but I thought it might be useful to aggregate and organize some of the most useful information somewhere so that the key bits of information can be found more easily.
This is just a start for now.



## Vim resources

### vim tutor

It's possible to hack by for quite a while with "just enough vim", but if you're really looking to use it as a primary text editor, it helps to go through a thorough explanation of certain things.
In my opinion, the `vimtutor` program is the best way to do this, as it literally just plops you into vim with a text file of lessons loaded up, so you are forced to use `vim` as you learn `vim`.
This was how I learned.

### Vim plugins and Vundle

The vim community has amassed a legion of plugins which extend vim to do all sorts of cool things.
It used to be that installing and maintaining all these plugins was a pain in the butt, but now we have a plugin for managing plugins called Vundle.
It's awesome, and you should use it.

This section will also contain some useful vim plugins you may wish to consider.

### tslime

This really cool vim plugin lets you highlight code in vim's visual mode, and send it to a tmux pane of your choosing.
By sending to a REPL pane, you can use this to quickly highlight and evaluate chunks of code in your editor.

### Nerdtree

This vim plugin gives you a `tree` like file navigator sidebar from within vim, so you can quickly find and edit files.

### Nerdcommenter

Helpful commands for commenting/uncommenting entire blocks of code

## Emacs

Emacs is another powerful, old school terminal based text editor which you may also consider.
Maybe someone else can add some resources here with respect to it.



## Tmux

### tmux plugin manager (tpm)

Similarly to vim, tmux can be extended with various plugins.
And just as with vim, we have a plugin which helps us do this, called `tpm`.
